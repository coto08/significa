  title: Tools should adapt to the user, not the other way around.
  text: |
    The same way tools were invented that allowed farmers to work on an upright position, digital products should have its user as their main concern. They should, somehow, improve people's life by having a good sense of the problem it solves, who is it solving it for and, above all, how it is solved.
    Only, there's some peculiarities to digital products. Things can get really complex, really quickly, and a pragmatic, synthetic and clear vision is essential to be able to create something that, after all, is meant to be used. Emotions also have a big role to play and developing clear and beautiful aesthetics is of the utmost importance to create a pleasant environment in which the user actually enjoys the time spent in it. In the end, we're all suckers for beautiful things that just work™
